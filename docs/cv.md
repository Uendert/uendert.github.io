# Curriculum Vitae

**Uendert Andrade**,
_Leinweber Postdoctoral Fellow, Department of Physics, University of Michigan_
<!-- Leinweber Institute for Theoretical Physics -->

I am a cosmologist working on precision tests of the standard cosmological model using large-scale structure surveys, with a focus on baryon acoustic oscillations, growth–geometry consistency tests, and survey validation. I am currently a Leinweber Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Michigan and a leading contributor to DESI BAO analyses.

## **Leadership & service roles**

### Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)

**Collaboration-internal reviewer**  
*July 2025*

**DR2 BAO Co-Coordinator, GQC Working Group**  
*August 2024 – October 2025*  
The Galaxy & Quasar Clustering (GQC) Working Group leads one of the key DESI science programs, delivering precision measurements of cosmic distances and structure growth.  
As co-coordinator of the DR2 BAO Key Project, I oversaw coordination between GQC and other DESI working groups (e.g. Cosmological Parameter Estimation) to ensure delivery of the DR2 cosmological results.

**Lead, DR2 BAO Topical Group**  
*August 2024 – October 2025*  
Led galaxy clustering BAO analyses within the GQC Working Group, including reconstruction, distance-scale measurements, and systematic validation across all DESI GQC tracers.
